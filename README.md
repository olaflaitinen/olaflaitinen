### About Me

I am a PhD researcher and AI scientist working at the intersection of human-AI collaboration, medical imaging, and systems biomedicine. Currently pursuing dual doctoral degrees at DTU Compute (Human-XAI Collaboration for Fetal Ultrasound Imaging) and University of Luxembourg (Systems and Molecular Biomedicine), while serving as CTO and Co-Founder of Skolyn, a clinical AI company developing explainable diagnostic systems.

My research spans medical AI, computational biology, urban intelligence, and trustworthy machine learning. I have contributed to projects at Google Health AI, Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence, Uppsala University, and the European Research Council, with publications in high-impact venues covering topics from federated learning to physics-informed neural networks.
