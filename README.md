### Computational Scientist | Medical AI & Clinical Bioinformatics

I am a dedicated and results-oriented computational scientist with deep expertise in bridging **clinical bioinformatics** with **trustworthy Artificial Intelligence**. My work focuses on building scalable, reproducible systems to translate high-dimensional biological data (genomics, proteomics) into clinically actionable insights. I have a strong track record in developing interpretable machine learning models for medical imaging and diagnostics, and a passion for engineering robust MLOps and data governance frameworks in regulated healthcare environments.

### üöÄ Featured Projects

Here is a selection of projects that represent my core expertise. These repositories reflect my work in building end-to-end computational systems, from data processing to model interpretation and deployment.

| Project | Description | Key Technologies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| üß¨ **`Nextflow-Clinical-Genomics-Pipeline`** | An end-to-end, nf-core compliant pipeline for processing WGS/WES data from clinical cohorts. It automates alignment (BWA), variant calling (GATK Best Practices), annotation (VEP), and quality control. Designed for scalability on HPC clusters using SLURM. *(Ref: Bioinformatician role at Link√∂ping University).* | `Nextflow`, `nf-core`, `Groovy`, `Docker`, `Singularity`, `GATK`, `HPC` |
| üß† **`XAI-for-Medical-Imaging`** | A PyTorch-based framework for developing and validating deep learning models for medical image analysis (e.g., tumor segmentation in neuroradiology).

| üåê **`Multi-Omics-Network-Analysis-Neuro`** | A Python library for integrating transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) and proteomic (Mass-Spec) data to construct and analyze dysregulated biological networks. Implements methods for identifying key driver nodes and pathways in the context of early-stage neurodegeneration. *(Ref: PhD at University of Luxembourg).* | `Python`, `NetworkX`, `Pandas`, `Scikit-learn`, `Statsmodels` |
| ‚òÅÔ∏è **`MLOps-for-Healthcare-on-GCP`** | A reference architecture using Terraform to deploy a secure, HIPAA/GDPR-compliant MLOps environment on Google Cloud Platform for training and serving clinical predictive models. Includes Vertex AI Pipelines, secure data handling with Cloud Healthcare API, and model monitoring. *(Ref: Google experience & GCP Certifications).* | `GCP Vertex AI`, `Terraform`, `Docker`, `Kubernetes (GKE)`, `Cloud Healthcare API` |
| üõ°Ô∏è **`FAIR-and-Secure-Health-Data-Framework`** | A non-code repository containing templates, checklists, and policy documents for implementing FAIR Data Principles and 'Privacy by Design' in health research projects. Includes Data Management Plan (DMP) templates and guides for GDPR compliance. *(Ref: Schmidt et al. 2024; CIPP/E & CDPSE Certs).* | `FAIR Principles`, `GDPR`, `HIPAA`, `Data Governance`, `Markdown` |
| üë®‚Äçüè´ **`Teaching-Data-Science-Notebooks`** | Public course materials, including Jupyter Notebooks, datasets, and exercises for the TAMS11 (Introductory Statistics) and TDDE15 (Intro to Data Analysis with Python) courses taught at Link√∂ping University. | `Jupyter`, `Numpy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Scikit-learn`, `R` |
