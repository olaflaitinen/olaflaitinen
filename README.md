## Overview

I build clinically deployable machine learning systems at the intersection of **medical imaging**, **clinical genomics**, and **multi-omics**.  
My work spans research and engineering: **problem formulation → reproducible pipelines → interpretable modeling → multi-site validation → deployment in regulated settings**.

**Current focus**
- Explainable clinical decision support (model transparency, auditability, failure-mode analysis)
- Federated learning evaluation across institutions (privacy-preserving benchmarking, heterogeneity)
- Clinical genomics operations (variant interpretation workflows, Nextflow/nf-core pipelines)
- Multi-omics integration (network/graph learning for biomarker discovery)

## Research and Engineering Themes

### Trustworthy Medical AI
- Interpretability: SHAP, Integrated Gradients, attention-based analyses; structured explanation reporting
- Reliability: calibration, uncertainty estimation, OOD behavior, subgroup and shift analysis
- Human-AI collaboration: evaluation protocols, reader studies, interaction design constraints

### Federated Learning in Healthcare
- Robust training under institutional heterogeneity (site effects, device/protocol variation)
- Privacy-preserving evaluation design and reporting (reproducible metrics across sites)
- Operational constraints: governance, logging, monitoring, update strategies

### Clinical Genomics and Multi-Omics
- Rare disease workflows: variant calling/annotation/interpretation and reporting practices
- Multi-omics integration: network analysis, graph neural networks, latent factor models
- Reproducibility: Nextflow/nf-core conventions; provenance, parameterization, environment pinning

### Interoperability and Standards
- Imaging: DICOM, NIfTI; toolchains (e.g., SimpleITK, 3D Slicer ecosystems where applicable)
- Health data: HL7/FHIR integration patterns; system boundaries and audit trails
