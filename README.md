## Positioning

I build clinically deployable, trustworthy AI systems at the intersection of medical imaging, clinical genomics, and multi-omics.  
My work spans end-to-end research engineering: problem formulation, dataset governance, model development, interpretability, validation, and deployment workflows aligned with real-world clinical constraints (privacy, safety, auditability, interoperability).

**Primary themes**
- Explainable and human-centered AI for clinical decision support
- Federated learning and privacy-preserving evaluation across institutions
- Multi-omics integration and network-based modeling for precision medicine
- Robust, reproducible ML pipelines for regulated environments
